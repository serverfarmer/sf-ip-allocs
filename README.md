# Overview

This repository contains `sf-ip-allocs` extension to [Server Farmer](https://github.com/serverfarmer/). This particular extension provides a single file, which
can be used independently of Server Farmer, with any other solution as well.

File [`allocs`](https://github.com/serverfarmer/sf-ip-allocs/blob/master/allocs) has a generic shell syntax, and can be directly included into most firewall configuration scripts.
It defines several variables, where each variable contains a list of IP addresses (or ranges) for particular Internet Service Providers, Cloud providers, and some other services.

Example variable:

```
TPNET="79.184.0.0/13 80.48.0.0/13 83.0.0.0/11"
```

If you don't have any firewalling solution, please take a look at [Server Farmer scriptable firewall](https://github.com/serverfarmer/sf-ip-fw) (for Linux).


# Long Term Support declaration

This public repository is actively maintained since Sep 2016. Previously, some of these variables were maintained since 2009, in private repository, as part of commercial solution.

Right now, our plan regarding this repository is to maintain it as long as possible. Also, **it will stay free** and, as far as possible, without any changes breaking compatibility.


# Which IP ranges are listed, and which not?

1. Most Internet Service Providers have 2 types of [IP allocations](http://www-public.int-evry.fr/~maigron/RIR_Stats/RIPE_Allocations/Allocs/PL.html):

   - for DHCP/NAT/etc. - from which outgoing traffic is directed to other networks (for you, it's incoming traffic)
   - for hosting services (web pages, mail servers etc.) and other internal uses

   Variables in `allocs` file are related only to the first type.

2. There are some global ISP brands in Poland (eg. T-Mobile, Orange). Variables like `ORANGE` are related only to their polish branches and polish networks.

# How to contribute

We are open to add new variables, related to important ISPs or services, and to update existing ones (we have notifications about changes where possible, but still we can miss something).
Just [create a new issue](https://github.com/serverfarmer/sf-ip-allocs/issues) for us.
