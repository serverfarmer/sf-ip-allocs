sf-ip-allocs extension provides a shell include script with variables
containing IP address ranges allocated for several ISPs, mainly from
Poland.

This extension was built primarily to be used by custom non-public
firewalling solutions made by Fajne.IT for its customers, as a common
IP address list.

Of course, everyone is welcomed to use this extension as well.
